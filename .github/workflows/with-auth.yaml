# Workflow derived from https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples
# Need help debugging build failures? Start at https://github.com/r-lib/actions#where-to-find-help

# NOTE: This workflow is overkill for most R packages and
# check-standard.yaml is likely a better choice.
# usethis::use_github_action("check-standard") will install it.
