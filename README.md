The goal of gargle is to take some of the agonizing pain out of working
with Google APIs. This includes functions and classes for handling
common credential types and for preparing, executing, and processing
HTTP requests.

The target user of gargle is an *R package author* who is wrapping one
of the ~250 Google APIs listed in the [APIs
Explorer](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer). gargle aims to
play roughly the same role as [Google’s official client
libraries](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/), but for
R. gargle may also be useful to useRs making direct calls to Google
APIs, who are prepared to navigate the details of low-level API access.

gargle’s functionality falls into two main domains:

- **Auth.** The `token_fetch()` function calls a series of concrete
  credential-fetching functions to obtain a valid access token (or it
  quietly dies trying).
  - This covers explicit service accounts, application default
    credentials, Google Compute Engine, (experimentally) workload
    identity federation, and the standard OAuth2 browser flow.
  - gargle offers the `Gargle2.0` class, which extends `httr::Token2.0`.
    It is the default class for user OAuth 2.0 credentials. There are
    two main differences from `httr::Token2.0`: greater emphasis on the
    user’s email (e.g. Google identity) and default token caching is at
    the user level.
- **Requests and responses**. A family of functions helps to prepare
  HTTP requests, (possibly with reference to an API spec derived from a
  Discovery Document), make requests, and process the response.

See the [articles](https://gargle.r-lib.org/articles/) for holistic
advice on how to use gargle.

## Installation

You can install the released version of gargle from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("gargle")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("r-lib/gargle")
```

## Basic usage

gargle is a low-level package and does not do anything visibly exciting
on its own. But here’s a bit of usage in an interactive scenario where a
user confirms they want to use a specific Google identity and loads an
OAuth2 token.

``` r
library(gargle)

token <- token_fetch()
#> The gargle package is requesting access to your Google account.
#> Enter '1' to start a new auth process or select a pre-authorized account.
#> 1: Send me to the browser for a new auth process.
#> 2: janedoe_personal@gmail.com
#> 3: janedoe@example.com
#> Selection: 2

token
#> ── <Token (via gargle)> ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> oauth_endpoint: google
#>            app: gargle-clio
#>          email: janedoe_personal@gmail.com
#>         scopes: ...userinfo.email
#>    credentials: access_token, expires_in, refresh_token, scope, token_type, id_token
```

Here’s an example of using request and response helpers to make a
one-off request to the [Web Fonts Developer
API](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api). We show
the most popular web font families served by Google Fonts.

``` r
library(gargle)

req <- request_build(
  method = "GET",
  path = "webfonts/v1/webfonts",
  params = list(
    sort = "popularity"
  ),
  key = gargle_api_key(),
  base_url = "https://www.googleapis.com"
)
resp <- request_make(req)
out <- response_process(resp)

out <- out[["items"]][1:8]
sort(vapply(out, function(x) x[["family"]], character(1)))
#> [1] "Inter"          "Lato"           "Material Icons" "Montserrat"    
#> [5] "Noto Sans JP"   "Open Sans"      "Poppins"        "Roboto"
```
