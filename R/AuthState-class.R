#' Create an AuthState
#'
#' Constructor function for objects of class [AuthState].
#'
#' @param package Package name, an optional string. The associated package will
#'   generally by implied by the namespace within which the `AuthState` is
#'   defined. But it's possible to record the package name explicitly and
#'   seems like a good practice.
#' @param app An OAuth consumer application, as produced by [httr::oauth_app()].
#' @param api_key API key (a string). Necessary in order to make unauthorized
#'   "token-free" requests for public resources. Can be `NULL` if all requests
#'   will be authorized, i.e. they will include a token.
#' @param auth_active Logical. `TRUE` means requests should include a token (and
#'   probably not an API key). `FALSE` means requests should include an API key
#'   (and probably not a token).

#' @return An object of class [AuthState].

#' Authorization state
#'
#' An `AuthState` object manages an authorization state, typically on behalf of
#' a client package that makes requests to a Google API. This state is
#' incorporated into the package's requests for tokens and controls the
#' inclusion of tokens in requests to the target API:
#'   * `api_key` is the simplest way to associate a request with a specific
#'     Google Cloud Platform [project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy#projects).
#'     A few calls to certain APIs, e.g. reading a public Sheet, can succeed
#'     with an API key, but this is the exception.
#'   * `app` is an OAuth app associated with a specific Google Cloud Platform
#'     [project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy#projects).
#'     This is used in the OAuth flow, in which an authenticated user authorizes
#'     the app to access or manipulate data on their behalf.
#'   * `auth_active` reflects whether outgoing requests will be authorized by an
#'     authenticated user or are unauthorized requests for public resources.
#'     These two states correspond to sending a request with a token versus an
#'     API key, respectively.
#'   * `cred` is where the current token is cached within a session, once one
#'     has been fetched. This is a token produced by [httr::oauth2.0_token()].
#' An `AuthState` should be created through the constructor function
#' [init_AuthState()].
