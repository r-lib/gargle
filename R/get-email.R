# Good 3rd party overview re: learning about your Google user / token:
# https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/signing-in-with-google/verifying-the-user-info/
#
# It suggests perhaps we could recover, e.g., the email during token initiation?
# But I'm not sure and it might require a change in httr, in any case.
#
# Therefore, I focus on the two post hoc methods for retrieving info based on
# the token you've already got:
#   * userinfo endpoint
#   * tokeninfo endpoint
# Both require an additional HTTP request, so are "not recommended for
# production applications".
#
# I had working code to access both the userinfo and tokeninfo endpoints before
# I read this and there are a few differences between what I do and what they
# say to do. The discrepancies are around which token to send (ID? access? etc.)
# and where/how to send it. I conclude that there must be a few variations that
# work.
#
# Google's docs re: how to get user info:
# https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect#obtaininguserprofileinformation
# "Add your access token to the authorization header and make an HTTPS GET
# request to the userinfo endpoint, which you should retrieve from the Discovery
# document using the key userinfo_endpoint."
#
# Here's the OpenID Connect discovery document:
# https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
#
# Here's the URL for userinfo_endpoint, at the time of writing:
# https://openidconnect.googleapis.com/v1/userinfo


#' Get info on current user
#'
#' The userinfo endpoint can potentially return the user's entire profile, if
#' the token has the necessary scope. But, by default, gargle-mediated tokens
#' only include the `userinfo.email` scope, so don't expect to get much beyond
#' the email, unless you've explicitly scoped for more. `get_userinfo()` can
#' exploit built-in token refresh, although at the time of writing, the
#' motivating use case is to get and store the email for a freshly-obtained
#' token.
