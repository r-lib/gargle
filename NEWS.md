# gargle (development version)

## User interface

The user interface has gotten more stylish, thanks to the cli package (<https://cli.r-lib.org>).

`gargle_verbosity()` replaces `gargle_quiet()`.
Each such function is (or was) a convenience wrapper to query the option with that name.
Therefore, the option named "gargle_verbosity" now replaces "gargle_quiet".
If "gargle_verbosity" is unset, the old "gargle_quiet" is still consulted, but the user is advised to update their usage.

The new "gargle_verbosity" option is more expressive and has three levels:

* "debug", equivalent to the previous `gargle_quiet = FALSE`. Use for debugging
  and troubleshooting.
* "info" (the default), basically equivalent to the previous
  `gargle_quiet = TRUE`. Since gargle is not a user-facing package, it has very
  little to say and only emits messages that end users really need to see.
* "silent", no previous equivalent and of little practical significance. But it
  can be used to suppress all gargle messages.
  
The helpers `with_gargle_verbosity()` and `local_gargle_verbosity()` make it easy to temporarily modify the verbosity level, in the spirit of the [withr package](https://withr.r-lib.org).

## Other changes

`gargle_oob_default()` returns `TRUE` unconditionally when running in RStudio Server.

## Dependency changes

cli is new in Imports.

rstudioapi is new in Imports.

httpuv is new in Suggests. We encourage its installation in interactive sessions, if we're about to initiate OAuth flow, unless it's clear that out-of-band auth is inevitable.

gargle now relies on testthat >= 3.0.0 and, specifically, uses third edition features.

mockr is new in Suggests, since `testthat::use_mock()` is superseded.

# gargle 1.0.0

* Better handling of `BadRequest` errors, i.e. more specifics are revealed.

* `oauth_app_from_json` now supports JSON files from the "Web application"
  client type (#155).
  
* `request_retry()` is a drop-in substitute for `request_make()` that uses (modified) exponential backoff to retry requests that fail with error `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` (#63).

* Credentials used in selected client packages have been rolled. Users of bigrquery, googledrive, and googlesheets4 can expect a prompt to re-authorize the "Tidyverse API Packages" when using an OAuth user token. This has no impact on users who use their own OAuth app (i.e. client ID and secret) or those who use service account tokens.

# gargle 0.5.0

* [Troubleshooting gargle auth](https://gargle.r-lib.org/articles/troubleshooting.html)
  is a new vignette.

* All user-facing messaging routes through `rlang::inform()`, which (as of
  rlang 0.4.2) prints to standard output in interactive sessions and to
  standard error in non-interactive sessions (#133). Messaging remains under
  the control of the `"gargle_quiet"` option, which defaults to `TRUE`.
  
* The `Gargle2.0` class gains its own `$refresh()` method, which removes a
  token from gargle's cache when it cannot be refreshed (#79).
  
* `credentials_service_account()` and `credentials_app_default()` gain an
  optional `subject` argument, which can be used to pass a subject claim along
  to `httr::oauth_service_token()` (#131, @samterfa).

* `request_make()` defaults to `encode = "json"`, which differs from the httr
  default, but aligns better with Google APIs (#124).

* `field_mask()` is a utility function for constructing a
  Protocol-Buffers-style, JSON-encoded field mask from a named R list.

* All R6 classes use the new documentation capabilities that appeared in
  roxygen2 7.0.0.

* OAuth2 flow can only be initiated when `rlang::is_interactive()` is `TRUE`. If
  a new token is needed in a non-interactive session, gargle now throws an
  error (#113).

* The application default credentials path is fixed on non-Windows platforms
  (#115, @acroz).
  
* `request_develop()` can accept a parameter that appears in both the path and
  the body (#123).

* `response_process()` explicitly declares the UTF-8 encoding of the content in
  Google API responses [tidyverse/googlesheets4#26](https://github.com/tidyverse/googlesheets4/issues/26).
  
* `response_process()` is able to expose details for a wider set of errors.

# gargle 0.4.0

* Eliminated uninformative failure when OAuth tokens cached on R <= 3.5 are re-loaded on R >= 3.6. The change to the default serialization version (2 vs. 3) creates an apparent mismatch between a token's hash and its key. Instead of inexplicably failing, now we attempt to repair the cache and carry on (#109, [tidyverse/googledrive#274](https://github.com/tidyverse/googledrive/issues/274).

* In a non-interactive context, gargle will use a cached OAuth token, if it discovers (at least) one, even if the user has not given explicit instructions. We emit a recommendation that the user make their intent unambiguous and link to the vignette on non-interactive auth (#92).

* gargle consults the option `"httr_oob_default"`, if the option `"gargle_oob_default"` is unset. This is part of an effort to automatically detect the need for out-of-bound auth in more situations (#102).

* `credentials_service_account()` checks explicitly that `type` is `"service_account"`. This makes it easier to detect a common mistake, where the JSON for an OAuth client is provided instead of the JSON representing a service account (#93).

* `credentials_gce()` gains `cloud-platform` as a default scope, assuming that the typical user wants to "View and manage your data across Google Cloud Platform services" (#110, @MarkEdmondson1234).

# gargle 0.3.1

* [Non-interactive auth](https://gargle.r-lib.org/articles/non-interactive-auth.html) is a new vignette that serves as a guide for any client packages that use gargle for auth.

* `credentials_gce()` might actually work now (#97, @wlongabaugh).

* `credentials_app_default()` got a small bug fix relating to putting the token in the header (r-dbi/bigrquery#336)

* `token_fetch()` silently catches warnings, in addition to errors, as it falls
  through the registry of credential-fetching methods (#89).

* The yes/no asking if it's OK to cache OAuth tokens prints fully now
  (r-dbi/bigrquery#333).

# gargle 0.3.0

* The unexported functions available for generating standardized docs for
  `PKG_auth` functions in client packages have been updated.
  
* `token_userinfo()`, `token_email()`, and `token_tokeninfo()` are newly
  exported helpers that retrieve information for a token.

* `AuthState$set_app()` and `AuthState$set_api_key()` now allow setting a value
  of `NULL`, i.e. these fields are easier to clear.

* `credentials_byo_oauth2()` gains the ability to ingest a token from an object of class `httr::request`, i.e. to retrieve the `auth_token` component that holds an object of class `httr::Token2.0` that has been processed with `httr::config()`.

# gargle 0.2.0

* All built-in API credentials have been rotated and are stored internally in a way that reinforces appropriate use. There is a new [Privacy policy](https://www.tidyverse.org/google_privacy_policy/) as well as a [policy for authors of packages or other applications](https://www.tidyverse.org/google_privacy_policy/#policies-for-authors-of-packages-or-other-applications). This is related to a process to get the gargle project [verified](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/7454865?hl=en), which affects the OAuth2 capabilities and the consent screen.

* New vignette on "How to get your own API credentials", to help other package authors or users obtain their own API key or OAuth client ID and secret.

* `credentials_byo_oauth2()` is a new credential function. It is included in the
default registry consulted by `token_fetch()` and is tried just before
`credentials_user_oauth2()`.

# gargle 0.1.3

* Initial CRAN release
