\item{f}{A function to check.}

\description{
In the abstract, a credential fetching function is any function which takes a
set of scopes and any number of additional arguments, and returns either a
valid \code{\link[httr:Token]{httr::Token()}} or \code{NULL}.
}
\details{
Here we say that a function is valid if its first argument is named
\code{scopes}, and it includes \code{...} as an argument, since it's
difficult to actually check the behavior of the function.
