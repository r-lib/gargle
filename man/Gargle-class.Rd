\title{OAuth2 token objects specific to Google APIs}
\format{An R6 class object.}
\usage{
Gargle2.0
}
\description{
This is based on the \link[httr:Token]{Token2.0} class provided in httr. These
objects should be created through the constructor function
\code{\link[=gargle2.0_token]{gargle2.0_token()}}. In the base Token2.0 class, tokens are cached based on
endpoint, app, and scopes. For this subclass, the identifier or key is
expanded to include the email address associated with the token. This makes
it easier to work with Google APIs using multiple accounts.
