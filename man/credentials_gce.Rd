\title{Get a token from the Google metadata server}
\usage{
credentials_gce(
  scopes = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform",
  service_account = "default",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{scopes}{A character vector of scopes to request. Pick from those listed
at \url{https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes}.

For certain token flows, the
\code{"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email"} scope is unconditionally
included. This grants permission to retrieve the email address associated
with a token; gargle uses this to index cached OAuth tokens. This grants no
permission to view or send email and is generally considered a low-value
scope.}

\item{service_account}{Name of the GCE service account to use.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to all credential functions.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[=GceToken]{GceToken()}} or \code{NULL}.
}
\description{
If your code is running on Google Cloud, we can often obtain a token for an
attached service account directly from a metadata server. This is more secure
than working with an explicit a service account key, as
\code{\link[=credentials_service_account]{credentials_service_account()}} does, and is the preferred method of auth for
workloads running on Google Cloud.

The most straightforward scenario is when you are working in a VM on Google
Compute Engine and it's OK to use the default service account. This should
"just work" automatically.

\code{credentials_gce()} supports other use cases (such as GKE Workload Identity),
but may require some explicit setup, such as:
\itemize{
\item Create a service account, grant it appropriate scopes(s) and IAM roles,
attach it to the target resource. This prep work happens outside of R, e.g.,
in the Google Cloud Console. On the R side, provide the email address of this
appropriately configured service account via \code{service_account}.
\item Specify details for constructing the root URL of the metadata service:
\itemize{
\item The logical option \code{"gargle.gce.use_ip"}. If undefined, this defaults to
\code{FALSE}.
\item The environment variable \code{GCE_METADATA_URL} is consulted when
\code{"gargle.gce.use_ip"} is \code{FALSE}. If undefined, the default is
\code{metadata.google.internal}.
\item The environment variable \code{GCE_METADATA_IP} is consulted when
\code{"gargle.gce.use_ip"} is \code{TRUE}. If undefined, the default is
\verb{169.254.169.254}.
}
\item Change (presumably increase) the timeout for requests to the metadata
server via the \code{"gargle.gce.timeout"} global option. This timeout is given in
seconds and is set to a value (strategy, really) that often works well in
practice. However, in some cases it may be necessary to increase the timeout
with code such as:
}

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{options(gargle.gce.timeout = 3)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

A related auth flow that can be used on certain non-Google cloud
providers is workload identity federation, which is implemented in
\code{\link[=credentials_external_account]{credentials_external_account()}}.
